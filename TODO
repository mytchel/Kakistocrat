Checking dates of file
Timeout of sites. Geekhack should fail rather than take 3 fucking hours.
Site map (this can have last modified date which should be used)
robot file

Support other protocols, gemeni, gopher.

bugs:
    can get duplicate urls with the same path. Probably due to 
    add others not checking for path uniquness

Might help to group by domain rather than host. Possibly with exceptions.

Scores from a domain should count for less.

Hostnames cannot have { in them
