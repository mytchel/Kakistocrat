TODO:

Better memory management to avoid crashes.
  This is getting there. It is likely to be a slow process.

Save page output to an archive format.

Save links as urls, not pages ids.
Do away with page ids all together.

Roadmap:

Distributed crawl
Distributed index
Concurrent/Distributed search

Scorer that works properly.
    Will need to start with a users seed and expand.

    Lower scores for longer urls?

    Definatly lower for query params.

    Needs to not rule out results that are not in all postings.




Far Future:
    Support other protocols, gemeni, gopher.

    Might help to group by domain rather than host. Possibly with exceptions.

    Scores from a domain should count for less.
        Scores for sitemap pages should be lower
