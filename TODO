next:
    in process
        Change site scapper to take current dates and put any
        unchanged urls in a seperate list and don't update the index
        with them.

    add further groupings, done pairs, now do threes, and fours.
    cut off 's' and maybe other suffixs.
    quotes

eventually:

    Timeout of sites. Geekhack should fail rather than take 3 fucking hours.
    Site map (this can have last modified date which should be used)
    robot file

    Support other protocols, gemeni, gopher.

    Might help to group by domain rather than host. Possibly with exceptions.

    Scores from a domain should count for less.
