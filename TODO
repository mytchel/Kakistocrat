TODO:

Better memory management to avoid crashes.

Save page output to an archive format.
cleanup scraper.

Roadmap:

Support other protocols, gemeni, gopher.

Might help to group by domain rather than host. Possibly with exceptions.

Scores from a domain should count for less.
    Scores for sitemap pages should be lower

Distributed crawl
Distributed index
Concurrent/Distributed search

Scorer that works properly.
  * Will need to start with a users seed and expand.
