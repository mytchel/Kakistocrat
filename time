but slower in every way?

malloc is slower than realloc. Intersting.

This also doesn't copy out the counts to a vector on load.
Just keeps them as a pointer.

very strange that the single thread had 100% utilization
while the split up one did not.

Join indexs for sites together to try speed up merger.
But sorting more pairs takes longer.
This is with the cuttoff at 1000 pages. Bigger is worse.

but it doesn't seem to have helped much
./merger  34.48s user 2.55s system 225% cpu 16.432 total

10,000 page blocks which will just be one. 
There is also the problem that the sites / page ids will not be in order now.

./merger  28.30s user 2.68s system 225% cpu 13.736 total

it does seem to speed it up. uses more memory though, 4g for index, 2 for merger.

./merger  28.34s user 2.74s system 231% cpu 13.446 total

trying page blocks of 100 / site size. So, just merges tiny sites.
1g indexer, 2g merger

./merger  39.18s user 2.60s system 226% cpu 18.461 total

not much help at all.
No harm though. And it makes it easier to manage.

Will need to sort out ordering now though. ordering or aliasing.
